# Mastering JavaScript in 20 Days - My Personal Challenge

Welcome to my 20-Day JavaScript Learning Challenge! ðŸš€

In this challenge, I will be enhancing my JavaScript skills and knowledge over the course of 20 days. Each day, I will explore different aspects of JavaScript, building a solid foundation and gaining hands-on experience through practical exercises and projects.

## Overview
- **Duration:** 20 days
- **Objective:** Improve my JavaScript proficiency through daily learning and practice

- [Deep JavaScript Foundations, v3](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/deep-javascript-v3/)

## Daily Coding Challenges
Every day, I will be provided with a JavaScript coding challenge by the GSG team. I will test my skills and apply my knowledge to solve these challenges. Let's have fun while sharpening our coding abilities! ðŸ’ª

## Daily Learning Process
1. I will allocate 90 minutes each day to watch the assigned courses mentioned above.
2. I will solve the daily JavaScript coding challenges provided by the GSG team.
3. I will summarize my daily learnings and document my challenge solutions on a separate readme page.
4. I will repeat this process for the next 20 days, gradually advancing my JavaScript skills.
